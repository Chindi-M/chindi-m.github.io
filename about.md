# 🌍 About Me

Hi, I am an enthusiast with a passion for building secure, automated infrastructure that scales.

I enjoy turning complex infrastructure challenges into elegant and maintainable solutions using Kubernetes, Terraform, and GitOps practices. From architecting cloud-native platforms to implementing security first CI/CD pipelines, I focus on projects that make developers lives easier and systems more reliable.

## 🚀 My Journey

This blog is where I explore and share what I learn through hands on projects and experiments. What started as a curiosity about containers quickly grew into a deep dive into:

- Container orchestration with Kubernetes  
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform  
- GitOps workflows with ArgoCD  
- Security automation and DevSecOps practices  
- Building platforms that empower development teams

I document practical lessons, project experiments, and the insights I gain along the way so others can learn from the experiences and get inspired to try something similar.

## 🎯 Philosophy & Approach

**Build in Public**  
I share my learning journey including mistakes and failures. There is no such thing as a stupid question in tech.

**Automate Everything**  
If a task is repeated more than twice, it should be automated. Infrastructure as Code is essential for reliability and scalability.

**Security First**  
Security is not something added at the end. It is part of every design decision from day one.

**Document Relentlessly**  
Future you and your teammates will thank you. If it is not documented, it does not exist.

**Community Over Competition**  
The tech community thrives on sharing knowledge. I am happy to help anyone exploring DevOps or cloud engineering.
