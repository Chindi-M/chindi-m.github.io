# My Personal Lab: Exploring Cloud, DevSecOps, AI, and Automation

Hi, I'm passionate about automation, security, and building resilient, scalable infrastructure.

This is my personal lab, a space where I experiment with cloud platforms, DevSecOps, AI, and automation. I turn complex challenges into elegant, maintainable solutions, from Kubernetes clusters to fully automated cloud environments.

---

## 🛠️ What I Do

I specialise in:

- **Infrastructure as Code** : Terraform, Pulumi, AWS CDK
- **Kubernetes & Container Orchestration** : EKS, GKE, Docker, Helm
- **CI/CD & Automation** : GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, ArgoCD
- **Cloud Architecture** : AWS, GCP, Azure multi-cloud solutions
- **DevSecOps** : Security scanning, compliance, secrets management

---

## 🚀 Current Focus

I'm actively building and learning:

- **GitOps workflows** with ArgoCD and Flux
- **Platform engineering** with Backstage
- **Security automation** integrating Trivy, Checkov, and Snyk
- **Observability** using Prometheus, Grafana, and OpenTelemetry
- **Home lab experiments** with Raspberry Pi Kubernetes clusters

## 💡 Philosophy

**Dream it. Build it. Ship it. Automate it.**

I believe the best way to learn is by building real projects, breaking them, fixing them, and documenting the journey. This blog is my public learning space: sharing wins, failures, and everything in between.

## 🤝 Let's Collaborate

I'm always open to:

- **Open-source contributions** (Terraform modules, Kubernetes operators)
- **Technical discussions** on cloud architecture, DevSecOps, AI, and automation
- **Mentoring** and sharing knowledge with others exploring tech
- **Collaborative projects** in platform engineering, DevSecOps, or cloud-native solutions

## 🎯 Why This Blog Exists

This is my personal space to explore and share what I learn about cloud platforms, DevSecOps, AI, and automation. There is so much information out there, including tools, tutorials, and “best practices,” that it can easily feel overwhelming.

This blog has three main purposes:  

**For Me**  
A public learning journal that helps me understand concepts better by explaining them clearly.  

**For You**  
Practical, honest content about DevOps, cloud engineering, and building resilient infrastructure.  

**For the Community**  
A resource for anyone exploring tech, especially those from non-traditional backgrounds or self-taught paths.  

If you find something useful here, consider [sharing it](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=YOUR_SITE_URL) or [reaching out](/contact) to say hello. Feedback helps me create better content.
