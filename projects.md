## Featured Projects


## 🎯 What's Next

I'm currently working on:

- **Contributing to major OSS projects**: More substantial contributions to ArgoCD and Terraform providers
- **Advanced Kubernetes patterns**: Operators, admission controllers, custom schedulers
- **Platform engineering deep-dive**: Building comprehensive internal developer platforms
- **Writing technical guides**: In-depth tutorials on complex topics

## 📝 Project Documentation Philosophy

All my projects follow these principles:

**Clear README**: What it does, why it exists, how to use it  
**Architecture diagrams**: Visual representation of components  
**Step-by-step guides**: Reproducible setup instructions  
**Troubleshooting section**: Common issues and solutions  
**Lessons learned**: What went wrong and how I fixed it

Because if it's not documented, it doesn't exist.
